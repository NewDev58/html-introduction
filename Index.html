<h5>A funny story</h5>
<h6>TL;DR</h6>
Once I saved someone's big embarrassment by making silly voices

When I was a teenager I dared to make fun of other people. Once someone made
a recording, because back then having recording apparatus were popular between
people of my age and little older. When I was listening to the recordings, I
accidentally overwrote a file with funny sounds. Later I got to hear that
other people got ahold on that tape and started listening. It was too embarrasing, so
that person wanted that not everybody heard of it. When they were listening,
it was getting to a part where it would be really embarassing, but suddenly
they'd hear my funny sounds had overwritten the original recording, which was
very silly, but it saved his life. In the end, it was all good. They did know
it was me because of my voice.
